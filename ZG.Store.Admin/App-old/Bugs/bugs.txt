* asp.net core web api by default don't serve static files.
  have to add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles and add app.UseStaticFiles();

* have to enable CORS for the angular app because angular 2+'s default working environment runs a development 
  server off a seperate port which is effectively a seperate domain and all calls back to the main ASP.NET site 
  for the API calls effectively are cross domain calls
  
* a property need to be initialized if it is bound to html elements, 
  otherwise error happens because the property is undefined even if you try to set it in ngOnInit.

* element attribute can be bound like this [attributename]

* sometimes the url in addressbar won't change to the new url if the component handles it has error.
