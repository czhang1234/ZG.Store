 
* a property need to be initialized if it is bound to html elements, 
  otherwise error happens because the property is undefined even if you try to set it in ngOnInit.

* element attribute can be bound like this [attributename]

* sometimes the url in addressbar won't change to the new url if the component handles it has error.
