* asp.net core web api by default don't serve static files.
  have to add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles and add app.UseStaticFiles();

* have to enable CORS for the angular app because angular 2+'s default working environment runs a development 
  server off a seperate port which is effectively a seperate domain and all calls back to the main ASP.NET site 
  for the API calls effectively are cross domain calls

* use Angular CLI

* problem: reload cause 404 because server could not found index.html in another dir, e.g. http://localhost:50105/productcategories
  solution: put { useHash: true } in app-routing.module.ts

* changed outDir from "dist" to "../wwwroot" as "outDir": "../wwwroot" in .angular-cli.json
