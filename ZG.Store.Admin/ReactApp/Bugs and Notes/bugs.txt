* click on the Posts link on a blog row always navigate to the blog details page
  that was because I had this code:
  handleRowClick(blogId) {
        this.props.router.push('/blog/' + blogId);
    }

* objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {}).
  got this error in PostForm.js when I have  <Field name="status" component={select}>, which is from the redux-form tutorial.
  the error is gone when I change component={select} to component="select"
